# This is an example set of configuration options that can be placed in
# SiriProxy's main config.yml file for the plugin to control Heatmiser's range
# of Wi-Fi thermostats via their iPhone interface.

# Modifying the options in this file has no effect. They must be placed in
# SiriProxy's main config.yml file (usually within ~/.siriproxy).
# Run 'siriproxy bundle' after changing the plugin configurations.
