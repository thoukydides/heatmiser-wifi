= Voice Control from an iPhone or iPad via !SiriProxy =

Pete Lamonica's [https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy SiriProxy] allows the connection between an iOS device and Apple's Siri servers to be intercepted. Plugins can then be used to locally extend the functionality of Siri.

[http://thelifeofraspberrypi.blogspot.co.uk/ Dave Black] has produced a such a plugin allowing voice control of Heatmiser Wi-Fi thermostats using this project's Perl scripts. See his [http://thelifeofraspberrypi.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/setting-up-siriproxy-to-heatmiser-image.html pre-prepared Raspberry Pi disk image and setup instructions] for more details.
