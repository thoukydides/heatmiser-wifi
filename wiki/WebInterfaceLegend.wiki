The [InstallationWebInterface Web Interface] uses a variety of line styles and flags to display the thermostats' activity.

Note that starting or restarting the daemon results in the current state of the thermostat being recorded, and hence flags being displayed in the web interface, even if there has been no change of state.

== Lines for Central Heating ==

The following line styles and colours are used to show the various temperatures:
|| *Style* || *Description* ||
|| http://heatmiser-wifi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/legend-line-room.png   || Room temperature as measured by the thermostat ||
|| http://heatmiser-wifi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/legend-line-target.png || Target temperature that the thermostat is/was trying to achieve ||
|| http://heatmiser-wifi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/legend-line-comfort.png || Comfort level programmed target temperature (shown even if the heating is switched off to provide a guide as to the preferred temperature profile) ||
|| http://heatmiser-wifi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/legend-line-external.png || External temperature provided by an optional online weather service ||
|| http://heatmiser-wifi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/legend-band-heating-active.png || Thermostat has switched the heating on (the boiler will not generally be on for these full periods since it will have its own thermostat based on the water temperature) ||

The small navigator chart shows the same room temperature data as the main chart, but for the full history that has been logged. This can be used to zoom in on the section of interest.

== Flags for Central Heating ==

The reason for changes to the target room temperature are indicated by circular flags just above the target temperature line:
|| *Flag* || *Description* ||
|| http://heatmiser-wifi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/legend-flag-heating-off.png  || The thermostat is switched off ||
|| http://heatmiser-wifi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/legend-flag-heating-holiday.png || Holiday mode, frost protection enabled until return date ||
|| http://heatmiser-wifi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/legend-flag-heating-away.png || Summer mode, frost protection enabled indefinitely ||
|| http://heatmiser-wifi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/legend-flag-heating-hold.png || Temperature hold, for selected duration ||
|| http://heatmiser-wifi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/legend-flag-heating-manual.png || Temperature adjusted manually, until next programmed comfort level ||

Two additional flags for normal timer operation are currently disabled, but can be displayed by uncommenting the relevant lines of the `index.html` file:
|| *Flag* || *Description* ||
|| http://heatmiser-wifi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/legend-flag-heating-comfort.png || Target temperature is the programmed comfort level ||
|| http://heatmiser-wifi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/legend-flag-heating-optimum.png || Optimum start has increased the target temperature ahead of the next programmed comfort level ||

== Flags for Hot Water ==

If the thermostat also controls hot water then changes to its state are indicated by square flags at the bottom of the chart:
|| *Flag* || *Description* ||
|| http://heatmiser-wifi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/legend-flag-hotwater-off.png || The thermostat is switched off ||
|| http://heatmiser-wifi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/legend-flag-hotwater-holiday-off.png || Holiday mode, hot water disabled until return date ||
|| http://heatmiser-wifi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/legend-flag-hotwater-away-off.png || Away mode, hot water disabled indefinitely ||
|| http://heatmiser-wifi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/legend-flag-hotwater-timer-on.png || Hot water is on, controlled by timer ||
|| http://heatmiser-wifi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/legend-flag-hotwater-timer-off.png || Hot water is off, controlled by timer ||
|| http://heatmiser-wifi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/legend-flag-hotwater-boost-on.png || Hot water is on, manual boost ||
|| http://heatmiser-wifi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/legend-flag-hotwater-manual-on.png || Hot water is on, manual override ||
|| http://heatmiser-wifi.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/legend-flag-hotwater-manual-off.png || Hot water is off, manual override ||
