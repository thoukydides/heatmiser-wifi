= Heatmiser V3 System Protocol =

Heatmiser Wi-Fi thermostats expose two interfaces accessible via TCP/IP: an embedded web server running on port 80, and a Wi-Fi system protocol on port 8068. The latter interface is used by this software, as well as by Heatmiser's own iPhone/iPad and Android apps. It is a variant of the Heatmiser V3 System Protocol, running over TCP/IP rather than a serial link. For the RS485 variant of the protocol see Neil Trimboy's [http://code.google.com/p/heatmiser-monitor-control heatmiser-monitor-control] project.

== Documentation Clarifications ==

The original version (V3.1) of Heatmiser's System Protocol documentation contained many errors and ambiguities. Most of these have been rectified in the current version (V3.9), but a few remain in the details of the "DCB structure" that provides the thermostat's configuration and status:
 * When the whole DCB is read the individual parameters appear at the offset listed in the "Index in DCB" column of the documentation. Multi-octet values such as temperatures are little endian (less significant octet first), which is generally the reverse of the format stated in the DCB descriptions.
 * When individual parameters are written to the thermostat the address in the "Unique address" column of the documentation should be used. Multi-octet values such as the hold time are big endian (most significant octet first), which again is the opposite of what the DCB descriptions state.
 * The switching differential is specified as being in the range 1-3, but is actually in the range 1-6 in units of 0.5Â°C.

Additional corrections, especially for other models (DT-TS Wi-Fi and TM1-TS Wi-Fi), will be gratefully received.
