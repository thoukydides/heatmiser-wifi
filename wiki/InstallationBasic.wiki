= Basic Setup =

== Download the Software ==

Start by downloading the current version of the software using [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/ Subversion (SVN)]:
<code language="sh">
svn checkout http://heatmiser-wifi.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ~/heatmiser-wifi-read-only</code>

The example commands in these instructions assume that the files are checked out to `~/heatmiser-wifi-read-only`. Replace the path as appropriate.

For more details see the instructions on the [http://code.google.com/p/heatmiser-wifi/source/checkout Source Checkout] page.

== Install Perl ==

Check that Perl version 5 is installed using:
<code language=sh>
perl -v</code>
If it is already installed then it should output something like:
<blockquote><pre>
This is perl, v5.10.1 (*) built for x86_64-linux-gnu-thread-multi

 Copyright 1987-2009, Larry Wall

this system using "man perl" or "perldoc perl".  If you have access to the
Internet, point your browser at http://www.perl.org/, the Perl Home Page.</pre></blockquote>

Otherwise install it using:
<code language=sh>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install perl5</code>

Ensure that essential Perl packages are installed using:
<code language=sh>
sudo cpan CGI Cwd DBI File::HomeDir Getopt::Std IO::Socket JSON LWP::UserAgent Proc::Daemon Proc::PID::File Time::HiRes XML::Simple</code>

== Test Basic Operation ==

That should be all that's necessary for basic operation. Test the connection to the thermostat by running:
<code language="sh">
~/heatmiser-wifi-read-only/bin/heatmiser.pl -h heatmiser -p 1234</code>
where `heatmiser` should be changed to the IP address or hostname of the thermostat, and `1234` should be changed to the PIN code selected for the thermostat's iPhone interface.

This should display the current status of the thermostat:
<blockquote><pre>
### heatmiser ###
Heatmiser PRT version 1.2
Thermostat is ON (heating mode)
Time 2011-12-12 10:36:18
Temperature 20.6 deg C (internal)
Target 21 deg C
Heating is ON
Feature 01: Temperature format        C
Feature 02: Switching differential  0.5 deg C
Feature 03: Frost protect             1
Feature 04: Frost temperature        12 deg C
Feature 05: Output delay              0 minutes
Feature 06: Comms #                 n/a
Feature 07: Temperature limit         0 deg C
Feature 08: Sensor selection        internal
Feature 09: Floor limit             n/a
Feature 10: Optimum start             3 hours
Feature 11: Rate of change           38 minutes / deg C
Feature 12: Program mode            5/2 day
Weekday   1: 07:00 21 deg C
          2: 20:00 15 deg C
Weekend   1: 07:00 21 deg C
          2: 20:00 15 deg C</pre></blockquote>

The error `Unable to create socket: Invalid argument` indicates that the hostname is wrong. The error `Incorrect PIN used` should be self explanatory.

== Configuration File ==

Once basic operation has been confirmed the hostname and PIN number should be placed in a text file called `/etc/heatmiser.conf`. This avoids the need to keep typing these settings, and also allows operation of the daemon that logs data from the thermostat. The file should contain:
<code language="nocode">
HOST        heatmiser
PIN         1234</code>
where `heatmiser` and `1234` should be replaced by the hostname and PIN used above. Lines beginning with a hash character (#) are ignored, so can be used for comments.

(A space-separated list of hostnames can be used to support multiple thermostats.)

Check correct operation again by running the script, but without the hostname and PIN on the command line:
<code language="sh">
~/heatmiser-wifi-read-only/bin/heatmiser.pl</code>

If everything is working properly then you can now setup the [InstallationWebInterface Web Interface] to log the thermostat's operation and plot charts of the temperature. Alternatively, setup [InstallationTimeSync Automatic Time Synchronisation] to keep your thermostat's clock accurate and automatically adjust to the start and end of summer (daylight saving) time.
