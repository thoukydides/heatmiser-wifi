#summary Configuration options that can be placed in /etc/heatmiser.conf or ~/.heatmiser

= Configuration Files =

Many of the common options for this software can be placed in a global configuration file. This is necessary for the daemon used to log thermostat status to a database but useful for the other tools too.

Each script searches for configuration options in the following sequence (with the last value for each option being used):
  # Built-in defaults
  # `/etc/heatmiser.conf`
  # `~/.heatmiser`
  # Command line options

== File Format ==

A minimal`/etc/heatmiser.conf` or `~/.heatmiser` configuration file to connect to thermostat with hostname `heatmiser` using PIN access code `1234` would look like:
<code language="nocode">
HOST        heatmiser
PIN         1234</code>

Each option appears on a line by itself, with the option name followed by spaces and then the value(s). Blank lines and those starting with a hash character (`#`) are ignored.

== Configuration Settings ==

The following options can be configured:

|| *File Option* || *Command Line Option* || *Default Value* || *Description* ||
|| `DBPASSWORD` || `-a` _password_ || || Password for connecting to the database ||
|| `DBSOURCE` || `-s` _source_ || `dbi:mysql:heatmiser` || The data source name used for connecting to the database ||
|| `DBUSER` || `-u` _username_ || `heatmiser` || The user for connecting to the database ||
|| `DEBUG` || `-d` || `0` || Set to `1` to output information for debug purposes ||
|| `HOST` || `-h` _hostname_ || || Space separated list of IP addresses or hostnames for the thermostats (also used as database key, so should ideally be short and invariant) ||
|| `LOGFILE` || `-l` _filename_ || `/var/log/heatmiser` || The name of the file that the daemon should use for logging its operation ||
|| `LOGSECONDS` || `-i` _seconds_ || `60` || The interval in seconds between logging the thermostat's data to the database ||
|| `PIN` || `-p` _pincode_ || || PIN access code for the thermostat's Wi-Fi system protocol interface ||
|| `VERBOSE` || `-v` || `0` || Set to `1` to output additional information about the scripts' operation ||
|| `WKEY` || `-k` _apikey_ || || API key for the online weather service (only required for `metoffice` and `wunderground`) ||
|| `WLOCATION` || `-g` _location_ || || Location to request from the online weather service in the appropriate format for the service being used ||
|| `WLOGRATE` || `-r` _factor_ || `5` || How much slower should the online weather service be polled than the main logging rate ||
|| `WSERVICE` || `-w` _service_ || || Optional online weather service (`metoffice`, `wunderground`, `yahoo` or unset for none) for external temperature ||
|| `WUNITS` || `-f` _units_ || `C` || Temperature units to request from the online weather service (`C` or `F`); should match the thermostats' configuration ||
