# This is an upstart configuration file for the daemon that logs temperature
# and central heating usage data from the iPhone interface of Heatmiser's
# range of Wi-Fi enabled thermostats to a database for later analysis and
# charting. Create a symlink to it from "/etc/init/heatmiser_daemon", another
# from "/usr/local/bin/heatmiser_daemon" to the actual location of the
# "heatmiser_daemon.pl" script, and finally from "/etc/init.d/heatmiser_daemon"
# to "/lib/init/upstart-job". Run "sudo initctl reload-configuration" after
# creating the links.
